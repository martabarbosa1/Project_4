Cleaning of Kaggle_2_goodreads by steps:
1) Dropna from ISBN
2) Str.split to remove strings from column 'RatingDistTotal', 'RatingDist1', 'RatingDist2', 'RatingDist3', 'RatingDist4', 'RatingDist5'
3) Drop columns 'PublishDay', 'PublishMonth', 'Language', 'RatingDistTotal'
4) Drop rows from 'Authors'=="Anonymous" or "Unknown"
